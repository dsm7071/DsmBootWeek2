<h3>Trayectory</h3>

<aside>
    
<ul>
       <li>
        Born in Mexico city, I finished high school and started training in AeroMexico Formacion to become an Airline Pilot.
      </li>

        <li>
        After realizing it wasn't meant to be, I moved forwad to new endeavours. AeroMexico Formacion left me with many acquired skills;
        those skills being fruitful for me to become a professional. Hard work, Studying and discipline was their motto.
        </li>
        
        <li>
        Moving forward I was given an opportunity as a salesman at an enterprise, where I started selling Thermal rolls, sanitizer and Ethanol.
        With no previous education I learned on my own how to speak with clients, be persuasive and talk business.
        </li>
       
        <li>
        With a heavy heart and a new skillset that might be useful in the future, we are here today.
        </li>
        
        <li>
        Learning how to code!
      </li>
